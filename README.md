#Rolling Stones code institute Front end only Website

The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 

The primary target audiences of the site are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their 
back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings 
and Christmas parties. Rolling stones also have a large social media presence and as such have at links to their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
and YouTube pages. 

This website was created to be viewed over different devices from mobile to laptop. It was created with a mobile first approach.


##UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your
project is thebest way to help them achieve these things.

This website was created for both old and new fans of the Rolling Stones. With over 50 years on the road I wanted to provide fans with website 
that would provde quick access to the best material the band has produced through both video and audio as well to capture some the increible energy
they give at each of there shows with some of the best images I could find. The website also dedicates one page to providing some background 
information on the band and its members with some humour antidotes to create an interest in the band..
Once the view the matterial this should encourage fand either to contact the band to book them for an event or to attend an concert already
scheduled.
As part of promoting the band, the website has provide links to all the bands social media accounts.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

User Stores
We have two types of people accessing the website. One is existing fans some of which could be following the band for over 50 years and the
second type would be newer and maybe younger fans who may have stubbbled onto one of there songs and is looking for more information.

Existing and New fans.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to listen the best and most popular songs
Rolling Stones fans should be able to see there videos.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to see photos of the band.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to see information on any upcomming gigs.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to book the band for events.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to keep update with any new news and developments.
Rolling Stones fans should be able to find information about both the history of the band and its members.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves
either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is 
viewable inside the browser.

In the design of this webpage I descided to use pen and paper to create my wireframes, diagrams















Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with 
the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test 
file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful 
form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
