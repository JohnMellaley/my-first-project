# Rolling Stones code institute Front end only Website
## Overview

The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. The primary target audiences of the site are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicize their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. Rolling stones also have a large social media presence and as such have at links to their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. 

This website was created to be viewed over different devices from mobile to laptop. It was created with a mobile first approach.

## UX

### What is this website for?
This website was created for both old and new fans of the Rolling Stones. With over 50 years on the road I wanted to provide fans with a website that would allow quick access to the best material the band has produced through both video and audio as well to capture some the incredible energy they give at each of there shows with some of the best images I could find.
The website also dedicates one page to providing some background information on the band and its members with some funny antidotes to create an interest in the band.
Once the fans view the material this should encourage fans either to contact the band to book them for an event or to attend a concert already scheduled. As part of promoting the band, the website has provided links to all the bands social media accounts.

### User Stores
We have two types of people accessing the website. One is existing fans some of which could be following the band for over 50
years and the second type would be newer and maybe younger fans who may have stumbled onto one of their songs and is looking for more information.

**Existing and New fans.**

* Rolling Stones fans should be able to listen the best and most popular songs

* Rolling Stones fans should be able to see there videos.
* Rolling Stones fans should be able to see photos of the band.
* Rolling Stones fans should be able to see information on any upcoming gigs.
* Rolling Stones fans should be able to book the band for events.
